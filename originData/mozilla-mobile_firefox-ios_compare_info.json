If only a single Tab is part of search metadata group then we don't do anything with it and simply make it a part of Regular Tab\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n-- User opens a new tab and searches for a _Search Term 1_\r\n-- This _Search Term 1_ gets recorded as tab history metadata \r\n-- User opens another tab and searches for a _Search Term 1_ (same search) but now taps on a item on search page. This is a search follow-on scenario\r\n-- We combine both tabs into **Search Term 1 Group** in Tab Tray\r\n-- Search Groups are collection of tabs when user searches for a particular item from *Awesome Bar* \r\n\r\n## b) Regular Tabs\r\n\r\nThese are normal tabs that are not part of a group and user simply opens them by entering URL or long pressing on a link. \r\n\r\n## c) Inactive Tabs\r\n\r\nInactive tabs (if enabled) should put a tab to inactive mode after 4 days. The number of days after which a tab gets inactive might change in future. \r\n\r\n**Whats missing:** \r\nTelemetry and UI polish",

This requires a few changes to queries that expected a non-`nil` value.\r\n- Fixes a test that was expecting an integer to not match, rather than a `nil`.\r\n- A bookmark validation query could, by inspection, return a `NULL` for one of its values. This would result in an integer being returned by SwiftData, which would then be optionally cast to a string. This is supposed to safely fail, but it seems that we're tickling a compiler bug, resulting in the crash reported in this bug. In this commit we change the query to not return those values.",

So let us return only non-hidden views from\n`accessibilityElements` property. This does fix the bug.\n\nNote that such a behavior is not present when having a minimal example\nof view controller with bunch of buttons and labels as direct subviews\nof the VC's `view`, some of them `hidden` and some of them not, all\nreturned by `accessibilityElements` - there, still only the non-`hidden`\nviews are visible to VoiceOver. So it is interesting that the location\nbar exhibits this problem.\n\nWhile there, let's be safe and do post an `AXLayoutChanged` notification\nwhen the `hidden` status of one of the views changes. Maybe in iOS\n10 (or rather iOS X ?), things would stop working if we did not :-),\njust like they did in this case in iOS 9.",

You should consistently see token server\nretries (which eventually succeed).\n\nThe Mozilla storage service endpoints accept a HAWK requests signed at a\nvariety of different timestamps.  Eventually, we will track skew against\nan individual storage service endpoint and use it to improve our HAWK\nrequests.

As read/unread status is\nnot communicated by a word at the beginning of the accessibility label\nand the label begins with the title of the webpage, the user will also\nimmediately learn the beginning words of the title of webpage. I.e., the\ntitle of the webpage and read/unread status are learned simultaneously\nand immediately by the VoiceOver user.\n\nThis allows for quick navigation through the items, as within first\nfractions of a second VoiceOver user can identify both read/unread\nstatus and the beginning of the title of the article.\n\n\"Read\"/\"Unread\" is still announced after the title, in case the user is\nusing only braille display without speech, or the user has trouble\nrecognizing pitch changes, or the user is a Switch Control user (Switch\nControl does not respect the UIAccessibilitySpeechAttribute* attributes\n- <rdar://problem/20701917>).",

What\nhappens is that multiple parts of the code advance() the (single)\nFirefoxAccount.  They all start with the same initial datum, racing to\nuse the single-use token.  One connects first, remotely invalidating the\ntoken, and continues to do slow crypto things.  Others lose the\nconnection race and see a 401/110 from the fxa-auth-server since the\ntoken is now invalid.  The latter are displayed in the UI, even though\nthe first eventually succeeds.\n\nThis patch introduces a shared deferred and a lock for updating that\ndeferred.  I specifically want a reviewer other than (or in addition to)\nrnewman for this, since he sketched the solution and I want to ensure I\ncommunicated it well enough for a disinterested third party to\nunderstand.",
